JavaScript code to analyse a set of financial data

## About the project

I have written some code in JavaScript to analyse a set of financial data and extract specific information from it. The code quickly processes a large data set and identifies the requested
information of dataset size and summaries of the profit and loss information contained in the
dataset. The code finds the requested information much more quickly than trying to work it out
manaully, and could easily be adapted to other similar datasets.
